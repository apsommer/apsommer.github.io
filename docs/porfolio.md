I am Drew Sommer - an Android developer with a previous career in mechanical engineering. After specializing in machine dynamics for nearly a decade my passion for software engineering guided a career change. I believe in the democratization of the internet and creating mobile apps that are accessible to everyone. My latest product BarAudio provides audible realtime alerts for the financial markets. My recent project with Electrify America is a green initiative that simplifies the charging of electric vehicles. I love collaborating on teams and have experience mentoring others.

BarAudio is an Android app available on the Play Store as a monthly subscription. It's written in Kotlin with MVVM architecture using Compose, Firebase, and Google Cloud Functions on the backend. The app provides audible realtime alerts for financial securities including stocks, futures, options, and crypto.

The ecosystem of market exchanges, brokers, and third party platforms emits financial data in realtime. To be an effective trader, digital charts must be constantly monitored throughout the day. This causes eye strain and mental fatigue. Audio alerts from a mobile device provide an alternative source of information, allowing investors to step away from their screens with confidence.

Electrify America is an Android app available on the Play Store. It's written in Java with MVVM architecture and support for custom Google Maps, Near Field Communication (NFC), and WebSocket connections. The app enables users to find a nearby charging station, charge their vehicle, and manage the charging session at over 400+ locations.
